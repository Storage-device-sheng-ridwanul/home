			<div class="content-part-2">
				<h3>1. PunchCard
				<br> June 1, 1951</h3>
				<div class="img1"><img src="Punchcard.jpg"></div>
				<p>		<b>A punch card is essentially a piece of hardened paper (thin cardboard) that contains digital information. 
				<br>This information is represented by the presence or absence of holes in certain positions. It was only capable of 
				<br>storing text-based information.<b></p>
				<h3>2. Magnetic Tape
				<br>   January 1,1962</h3>
				<div class="img2"><img src="Magnetic_tape.jpeg"></div>
				<p>		This is a long plastic tape coated with iron oxide for use in magnetic recording. Data stored on magnetic tape is 
				<br>accessed sequentially, therefore if you want to access data at address 1500 you first must go through the 1499 address
				<br>before. Magnetic tape is still used today to create batch ups of important company data.	
				</p>
				<h3>3. HDD
				<br>   June 27, 1983</h3>
				<div class="img3"><img src="HDD.svg.png"></div>
				<p>		A standard component of any computer nowadays. The first was 3.5-inches in sizes could store 10MB. A hard drive has 
				<br>rotating platters on a motor-driven spindle within a protective enclosure. Data is magnetically read from and written to 
				<br>the platter by read/write heads that float above the platters. They can store audio, video, text and images.
				</p>
				<h3>4. CD ROM and CD-RW
				   <br>June 27, 1990</h3>
				<div class="img4"><img src="DVD-rom.jpg"></div>
				<p>		The Compact Disc is an optical disc used to store digital data. This means it uses lasers to read and write data to the surface.
				<br>It was originally developed to store and playback sound recordings, but now you can write data as well as read.
				</p>
				<h3>5. SSD
				<br>Invented in the year 1991. </h3>
				<div class="img5"><img src="SSD.webp"></div>
				<p>A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically
				<br>using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.
				</p>
				<h3>6. USB
				<br>January 30, 2000 </h3>
				<div class="img6"><img src="USB.jpg"></div>
				<p>Stands for Universal Serial Bus and it was designed to standardize the connection of computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, digital 
				<br>cameras, printers. USB's have no moving parts and are therefore robust and reliable. They are also very portable and can store text, images, 
				<br>video, audio.
				</p>
				<h3>7. HD DVD
				<br>Febuary 2, 2006 </h3>
				<div class="img7"><img src="DVD.webp"></div>
				<p>High Definition discs were supposed to take over from standard Dvd's and could stop up to 15 GB on a single disc. They were used for storing 
				<br>and playing back video. However, promotion stops in 2008 and Blu Ray became the standard.
				</p>
				<h3>8. Blu-Ray
				<br>Febuary 3, 2006 </h3>
				<div class="img8"><img src="Blu-Ray.jpg"></div>
				<p>		Blue-ray Disc is a form of optical storage (eg using lasers). They get the name Blu because blue lasers are used to read and write the data 
				<br>to the disc.They can store upto 25 GB on a single layers and can store multiple media types. Mainly used for videos today
